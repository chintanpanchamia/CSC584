# CSC584
Source Files for projects demonstrating basic AI behaviors catalogued under Movement and Decision-Making categories.
The folder containing H1 and H2 contains codes to different movement-based AI behaviors like Kinematic and Steering-based movements.
It also contains code for implementing A* Search and Dijkstra, the two most popular algorithms used in their modified forms
in the world of AI.

The H3 folder contains implementation of a Pacman-like game which incorporates the work from previous projects into Decision-Making
constructs like Decision-Tree and Behavior-Tree.

The Travelling Warrior is the capstone project which compares the two approaches to Path-finding: Dijkstra and A* Search, into a fun
automated sentry-shooter.
